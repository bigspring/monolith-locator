A branch locator plugin for [Monolith](https://github.com/bigspring/monolith)

## Current objectives

- [ ] Main locator page allowing locations to be shown on map, alongside a list for a given address (via Google Maps)
- [ ] Single views for locations featuring maps
- [ ] Multilingual support

### To be done later
- [ ] Optional geo-location showing locations based on current location
- [ ] Display other nearby locations when on single view
